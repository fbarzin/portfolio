  "description": "Hey there! I’m <b>Farzad</b>, a <b>Staff Software Engineer</b> passionate about <b>full-stack development</b> and building high-performance web and mobile applications. I specialize in <b>Flutter</b> 🐦, <b>NestJS</b> 🐱‍👤, <b>Next.js</b> ⚛️, and a variety of databases, creating scalable and intuitive digital experiences. I love tackling complex engineering challenges, mentoring developers, and bringing ideas to life through clean, efficient code. One of my main strengths is the ability to work <strong>collaboratively and efficiently</strong> with designers, product managers, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional products. I thrive in environments where engineering, design, and business strategy align to create seamless user experiences.<br /><br />I'm passionate about <strong>creating great user experiences</strong>, developing <strong>high-quality, well-architected software</strong>, and ultimately building products that make an impact. Whether working as a <strong>full-stack engineer</strong> or focusing on <strong>mobile, web, or backend development</strong>, I bring a strong technical foundation and a product-driven mindset to every project. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me watching <b>FC Barcelona</b> ⚽, playing soccer, or geeking out over history and cultures 📚. <br /><br />But let’s talk about the real stars of the show—my three cats: <b>Selena, Stevie, and Sasha</b> 🐱. Selena and Stevie were tiny kittens when we adopted them in Costa Rica, and they’ve been ruling the house ever since. Sasha, the scrappy street queen, joined us after we found her in Philadelphia, and she’s been keeping everyone in check.",
