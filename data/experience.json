On the technical side, I <strong>architected the frontend</strong> with <strong>Flutter</strong>, utilizing <strong>BLoC</strong> and <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> for maintainability and scalability.</p> <p>For the <strong>CRM backend</strong>, I built over <strong>90% of the services</strong> using <strong>FeathersJS, Sequelize, MySQL, and Postgres</strong>, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure. Through this project, I combined <strong>engineering leadership, product ownership, and hands-on development</strong>, delivering high-impact tools that empowered real estate agents.</p>",
